PROJECT 1:  AB Testing Project [Nov 2023]

Business Problem: 
Suave Wear is a cloting brand that's launching an ecommerce store. Currently, the pre-launched page is collecting emails from visitors. The plan is to collect as many emails for the website launch.

Goal:
As a Product Data Scientist, my goal is to design an, run and analyze an AB experiment that tests two versions of the email sign-up on the launch page.

Test Groups:

Control Group: The current sign up page with the Blue sign up button 
Teatment Group: The new sign up page with an Green sign up button

Business Outcome: Help the prpduct team determine which version of the sign up page to use based on the AB test result.
