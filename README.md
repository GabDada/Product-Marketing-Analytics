# AB Testing for Ecommerce Conversion

**Business Problem:** 
Suave Apparel is a cloting brand that's launching an ecommerce store. Currently, the pre-launched page is collecting emails from visitors. The plan is to collect as many emails for the website launch.

**Goal:**
As a Product Data Scientist, design, run and analyze an AB experiment that tests two versions of the email sign-up on the launch page.

**Test Groups:**

*Control Group:* The current sign up page with the Blue sign up button 

*Teatment Group:* The new sign up page with an Green sign up button

**Business Outcome:** Help the product team determine which version of the sign up page to use based on the AB test result.
